Will need a bit of luck negotiating a very wide starting position. It doesn't get any easier but on her best form she is good enough to take this out. PRETTY MISSY MAY (2) is looming as a real threat after a better effort last start, finishing third at this track over 1609m.

Likely to get all the favours from this nice draw. Has the talent to make her presence felt again. MY MASERATI (9) is in good form at present. Finished third at her latest appearance over 1609m at this track, beaten 3 metres. Will need a bit of luck negotiating a very wide starting position. It doesn't get any easier but on her best form she is good enough to take this out. PRETTY MISSY MAY (2) is looming as a real threat after a better effort last start, finishing third at this track over 1609m.

MAPLE SHADOW (6) is racing well with six top-five finishes in succession, the latest effort a third at this track over 1609m. Leading hope in a similar assignment. ACEFORTYFOUR REBEL (7) was responsible for a better effort last time out when runner-up over 1609m at this track. Should run a big race.
